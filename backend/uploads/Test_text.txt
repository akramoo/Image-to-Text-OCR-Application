Edge Detection: Focuses on identifying object edges by

classifying certain pixels as "edge pixels."

Popular algorithms:

o Canny Edge Detection: Uses filters, gradient calculation,
non-max suppression, and thresholding.

e Sobel Edge Detection: Uses Sobel operator for vertical
and horizontal convolutions to calculate gradients.
